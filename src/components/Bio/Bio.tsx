          Atletico is composed of 3 people. They met a long time ago on Panorama
          Barâ€™s dancefloor and have been playing music together since then.
          While sharing a broad common base in terms of taste, each member
          infuses their own touch, enabling them to deliver eclectic, dynamic
          sets. Atletico, a trio of DJs, was forged from a chance encounter on
          the legendary Panorama Bar dancefloor. Bound by a vast, shared musical
          foundation, each member infuses their individual essence into the mix,
          crafting sets that are both eclectic and pulsating with energy. This
          unique blend of collective harmony and personal flair makes their
          performances a captivating journey through sound.
